              <p>
                Game of Thrones is a hit fantasy tv show based on the equally
                famous book series "A Song of Fire and Ice" by George RR Martin.
                The show is well known for its vastly complicated political
                landscape, large number of characters, and its frequent
                character deaths.

                Of course, it goes without saying that this dataset contains
                spoilers ;)
              </p>
              <p>
                This dataset combines three sources of data, all of which are
                based on information from the book series.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Firstly, there is battles.csv which contains Chris Albon's
                  "The War of the Five Kings" Dataset. Its a great collection of
                  all of the battles in the series.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Secondly we have character-deaths.csv from Erin Pierce and Ben
                  Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian
                  Survival Analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally we have a more comprehensive character dataset with
                  character-predictions.csv. It includes their predictions on
                  which character will die.

                  http://awoiaf.westeros.org/ . It also includes their
